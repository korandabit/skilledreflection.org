## skilled reflection 
You care about some things more than others. You do some things more than others. 
_Skilled reflection_ is an attempt to clarify how your actions and values relate to each other, and make clear next-steps toward who you imagine yourself being.

We meet up to once a week to write privately for about an hour. Prompts and guidance for your reflection are provided.

## Spring 2020 sessions

First session:

"Reclaiming time: My personal goals  
versus the Universityâ€™s expectations"

**4-5 PM on Tuesday February 18th**   
at **Memorial library, room M179**.


Is there a time of the week that works better for you? Fill out [this survey](https://www.when2meet.com/?8746417-KjJ6N) (name optional) with your preference! 

*Note: We have a [new-join process](membership.md), but it isn't required to attend.*

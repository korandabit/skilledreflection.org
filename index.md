## skilled reflection 
You've had some feelings you kept to yourself. Maybe wrote them down, and sometimes they changed how you viewed yourself or what you did next. That's the power of reflection.

Other times, it seems you write and write, and the only thing that increases is disappointment and resentment.

_Skilled reflection_ is an attempt to concentrate this process, and increase the benefit in your life.

## you in 250
### is your life guided by you?
If you were suddenly comatose, what is it you would need your closest people to know? 

In your most intimate relationship, how clear is the line between you and other? How good are you at seeing this line, and relying on it in a way that benefits the relationship, rather than bruise it with defensive words?

Are you really that confident that every choice you make is the precise balance of effort and acceptance, tuned to what you, yourself define as important, real, and possible? 

Whether you are or aren't, it'd be good to try to prove it.

You need 20 minutes, and 250 words. Attempt to write down what you think is your essential self. That means whatever it needs to mean for you. It's not a philosophy prompt. It's a literal, concrete question-mark in front of your conscious self. Who are you? What do you do? Where do you come from? What matters?

Go ahead, now is a good time (or on your lunch break). Open any text editor, and check the clock. Have at it. Write 250 words in only 20 minutes. Fill that 250, and edit it if you have time. But the writing stops when 20 minutes of your life has passed.

Save that document. It's your life, however rough, or biased by what you just ate or thought you were going to do on the internet.

### purpose
You've got a snapshot in hand, of your soul. There it is. When you go to work, when you're too sick to remember the good times, when you need a reminder that isn't biased by whatever emotions the immediate moment is charging you with. An ID card of your soul.

Check on it when you need an easier way to quickly reference what you're about.

### don't rewrite, revise
A hot minute in your life has passed. A friend is a better one, and you threw out that old box of plastic crap. Is this hobby really going to stick, or is it just a bit of winter fever creeping in?

You open up the document. Yikes, that was a bit forced. Who did you think you were writing for? That's okay, it was pretty spontaneous, and so is now. You've got 20 more minutes. Go ahead and work on being a slightly more refined version of yourself.

Sit down for another 20, and fix up your 250. Read it in the first few minutes. What's obviously missing? What did you spend too many words on? Do a quick swap in the next few minutes. Now play surgeon to the rest, and see if you can make that soul-ID even more clearer. More useful for giving you some insight when you're on the front line of your life.

It was a good idea to toss that box, right?

*First session!*

Halloween is a socially accepted time to alter some of your identity and behavior. But outside of the freaky fun, I often catch myself playing dress-up and acting out of my own 'norms'. Sometimes I'm like, "Aw hey, that's not me." Or, "Aw shucks, why can't I be like that some more?" But if I don't stop for some 'aw hey...' time, I find myself stressed out and my shirt on backwards. ("Aw hey, Mark, TMI.") Before you put on costumes for play this Halloween, join us tomorrow for some Skilled Reflection with a little who-n-how-am-i-these-days. 

But even if you can't make it, be easy on all those altered-egos this Halloween. Not everything fits how we imagine it does.

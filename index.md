*First session!*

Halloween is a socially accepted time to alter some of your identity and behavior. But outside of the freaky fun, I often catch myself playing dress-up and acting out of my own 'norms'. Sometimes I'm like, "Aw hey, that's not me." Or, "Aw shucks, why can't I be like that some more?" But if I don't stop for some 'aw hey...' time, I find myself stressed out and my shirt on backwards. ("Aw hey, Mark, TMI.") Before you put on costumes for play this Halloween, join us tomorrow for some Skilled Reflection with a little who-n-how-am-i-these-days. 

But even if you can't make it, be easy on all those altered-egos this Halloween. Not everything fits how we imagine it does.

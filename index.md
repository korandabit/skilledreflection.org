## skilled reflection 
You've had some feelings you kept to yourself. Maybe wrote them down, and sometimes they changed how you viewed yourself or what you did next. That's the power of reflection.

Other times, it seems you write and write, and the only thing that increases is disappointment and resentment.

_Skilled reflection_ is an attempt to concentrate this process, and increase the benefit in your life.

### Brogden B18, Fri Oct 25, 3-4 PM
*First session!*

Halloween is a socially accepted time to alter some of your identity and behavior. But outside of the freaky fun, I often catch myself playing dress-up and acting out of my own 'norms'. Sometimes I'm like, "Aw hey, that's not me." Or, "Aw shucks, why can't I be like that some more?" But if I don't stop for some 'aw hey...' time, I find myself stressed out and my shirt on backwards. ("Aw hey, Mark, TMI.") Before you put on costumes for play this Halloween, join us tomorrow for some Skilled Reflection with a little who-n-how-am-i-these-days. 

But even if you can't make it, be easy on all those altered-egos this Halloween. Not everything fits how we imagine it does.

## skilled reflection  
[Skilled Reflection](https://win.wisc.edu/organization/skilledreflection) is a Student Organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

You care about some things more than others, and do some things more than others. 
_Skilled reflection_ is an attempt to clarify how your actions and values relate to each other, and make clear next-steps toward who you imagine yourself being.

How does this happen? 

We meet up to once a week to write privately for about an hour. Each session focuses on specific themes related to identity, goals, and being a student, with prompts for you to reflect and write on. More than anything, the time and writing are commitments to better navigate our complex lives.

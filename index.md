## B.Y.O. Conflict

This week is your chance to apply Skilled Reflection to exactly where it's needed in your life. Pick a difficult goal, topic, person, value, etc. that is taking up a lot of your mental energy / your TIME, and we'll provide an open-ended framework to aid your investigation of it. Not sure what to focus on? All the more reason to join us!

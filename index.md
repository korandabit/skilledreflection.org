## skilled reflection 
You care about some things more than others. You do some things more than others. 
_Skilled reflection_ is an attempt to clarify how your actions and values relate to each other, and find clear next-steps toward who you imagine yourself being.

We meet up to once a week to write privately for about an hour. We provide prompts and guidance for your reflection, to develop the goal mentioned above.

## Spring 2020 sessions

First session is **4-5 PM on Tuesday February 18th** at **Memorial library, room M179**. Send us a message if Tuesdays don't work.

*Note: Our by-laws describe a membership process that is currently not required to attend. We're in the process of re-evaluating it.*

# Upcoming_Sessions  

## Reclaiming Time from School  
**September 28th, 6 PM**
email skilledreflection (AT) gmail.com for a zoom invite.

*Session last hosted on 2/17/20*  

You're attending University for a personal, specific reason, but the University asks the same of you as everyone else (in your major).
What can you do about that?

## The break in Midterms and the Midterms in your Break  
*Session last hosted on 3/4/20*

Before you “endure” a torturous midterms and compensate with an exquisite break, take a hot minute (hour) to gaze at the nature of the roller coaster you’re on. 
If nothing else, you’ll be better prepared for the ups and downs. 

## The Leader Within  

*Session last hosted 09/14/20*

If you're going to be stuck at home with yourself, why not make that inner voice into something you enjoy hearing? 
Navigate the pandemic with a strong inner voice that you'll want to listen to.

## The Leader Within  

**Sept. 14th, 2020 at 6 PM**  
(5:45PM for new joins / guests)

If you're going to be stuck at home with yourself, why not make that inner voice into something you enjoy hearing? 
Navigate the pandemic with a strong inner voice that you'll want to listen to.


## Reclaiming Time from School  
*Session last hosted on 2/17/20*  

"Reclaiming time: My personal goals  
versus the University’s expectations"


## The break in Midterms and the Midterms in your Break  
*Session last hosted on 3/4/20*

Before you “endure” a torturous midterms and compensate with an exquisite break, take a hot minute (hour) to gaze at the nature of the roller coaster you’re on. 
If nothing else, you’ll be better prepared for the ups and downs.

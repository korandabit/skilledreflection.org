## This week (3/4)
Before you “endure” a torturous midterms, and compensate with an exquisite break, take a hot minute (hour) to gaze at the nature of the roller coaster you’re on with some skilled reflection. If nothing else, you’ll be better prepared for the ups and downs. 

"Midterm spring break: Spring break midterm"

Tuesday (3/3) 4 – 5 pm Steenbock library, rm 102
Friday (3/6), 1:30 – 2:30 pm College Library, rm 2258

## Last Themed Session

"Reclaiming time: My personal goals  
versus the University’s expectations"

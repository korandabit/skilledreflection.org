# document 1: you in 250
## is your life guided by you?
It's not a philosophy prompt. 
It's a literal, concrete question-mark in front of your conscious self. 
You need 20 minutes, and 250 words. 

- Are you aware of who you are?   
- What you stand for?  
- If you were suddenly in a coma, what is it you would need your closest people to know?   
- Where do you come from?   
- What matters?  

Whether your self is absolutely clear or not, now is a great time to take stock.

1. Open any text editor, and check the clock.   
2. Have at it. Write 250 words in only 20 minutes. Fill that 250, and edit it if you have time. But the writing stops when 20 minutes of your life has passed.  
3. Save that document. It's your life, however rough, or biased by what you just ate or thought you were going to do on the internet.  

## welcome to your life
Nothing is different. Except that you've just begun the process of identifying, and changing your life into whatever you want it to be. 

The next step? Live some of your life.  

Another day, revisit this 250 in another 20 minute session. Update it.  

Notice what you thought the first time, and what you newly realize is important. You're learning about yourself. You're learning the difference between who you are before you started learning. You're on the road to mastering the most important study of your life: yourself.
